# Python Practice

This repository contains beginner Python scripts.  
Focused on learning and practicing **loops** (`for` and `while`).

## What I Learned
- How to use `for` loops with `range()`
- How `while` loops work and when to use them
- Loop-based logic and flow

## Files Included

- `sum_to_n.py` – Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a user-defined number
- `countdown.py` – Counts down from a user-given number to 0 using a `while` loop
- `multiplication_table.py` – Prints a multiplication table from 1 to 12 for any number

## Files Included

### 1. `greet_user.py`
- Prompts the user to enter their name.
- Defines a function `greet_user(name)` to greet the user with a personalized message.

### 2. `check_even_odd_function.py`
- Takes a number as input from the user.
- Defines a function `number_checker(user_number)` that checks if the number is even or odd and prints the result.

### 3. `calculator_function.py`
- Takes two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input.
- Defines a function `calculate(num1, num2, operation)` that performs the appropriate arithmetic operation and prints the result.

## Purpose

This practice reinforces how to:
- Define and call functions in Python.
- Use conditionals inside functions.
- Handle user input and output.

Feel free to explore each file and run the code to test how functions work in different use cases.
