# Python Practice

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python scripts focused on learning and practicing core programming concepts such as loops, functions, lists, and user input handling.

---

##  What I Learned

- How to use `for` loops with `range()`
- How `while` loops work and when to use them
- Loop-based logic and flow control
- Creating and using functions
- Accepting and processing user input
- Working with Python lists

---

##   Files Included

###  Loop Practice

**`sum_to_n.py`**  
Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a user-defined number using a for loop.

**`countdown.py`**  
Counts down from a user-given number to 0 using a while loop.

**`multiplication_table.py`**  
Prints a multiplication table from 1 to 12 for any number.

###  Function Practice

**`greet_user.py`**  
- Prompts the user to enter their name  
- Defines a function `greet_user(name)` to greet the user with a personalized message

**`check_even_odd_function.py`**  
- Takes a number as input from the user  
- Defines a function `number_checker(user_number)` to check if the number is even or odd and prints the result

**`calculator_function.py`**  
- Accepts two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input  
- Defines a function `calculate(num1, num2, operation)` that performs the arithmetic operation and prints the result

###  List Practice

**`favourite_fruits.py`**  
- Creates a list of fruits  
- Accesses items using positive and negative indexing  
- Adds a new item using `.append()` and prints the updated list  
> Concepts: List creation, indexing, `.append()`, `print()`

**`even_numbers_list.py`**  
- Iterates through numbers from 1 to 20  
- Filters even numbers and stores them in a new list  
- Prints the final list of even numbers  
> Concepts: `for` loop, conditional statements, list building

**`shopping_list.py`**  
- Accepts 3 user inputs to build a shopping list  
- Appends each item to the list  
- Displays the completed shopping list  
> Concepts: `input()`, `.append()`, `print()`

---

##  Purpose

This practice reinforces:

- Using different types of loops (`for`, `while`)
- Defining and calling functions
- Writing conditional logic
- Managing and manipulating lists
- Accepting and using user input effectively
