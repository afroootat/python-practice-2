Python Practice
This repository contains beginner Python scripts focused on learning and practicing core Python concepts like loops, functions, and lists.

What I Learned
How to use for loops with range()

How while loops work and when to use them

Loop-based logic and flow control

Function creation and usage

User input handling

Working with Python lists

Files Included
Loop Practice
sum_to_n.py
Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a user-defined number using a for loop.

countdown.py
Counts down from a user-given number to 0 using a while loop.

multiplication_table.py
Prints a multiplication table from 1 to 12 for any number.

Function Practice
greet_user.py

Prompts the user to enter their name.

Defines a function greet_user(name) to greet the user with a personalized message.

check_even_odd_function.py

Takes a number as input from the user.

Defines a function number_checker(user_number) that checks if the number is even or odd and prints the result.

calculator_function.py

Takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input.

Defines a function calculate(num1, num2, operation) that performs the appropriate arithmetic operation and prints the result.

List Practice
favourite_fruits.py

Creates a list of fruits

Accesses items using positive and negative indexing

Adds a new item using .append()

Prints the updated list

Concepts: List creation, indexing, .append(), print()

even_numbers_list.py

Iterates through numbers from 1 to 20

Filters even numbers and stores them in a new list

Prints the final list of even numbers

Concepts: for loop, conditional statements, list building

shopping_list.py

Accepts 3 user inputs to build a shopping list

Appends each item to the list

Displays the completed shopping list

Concepts: input(), append(), print()

Purpose
This practice reinforces:

Using different types of loops

Defining and calling functions

Writing conditional logic

Managing and manipulating lists

Accepting and using user input

Feel free to explore each file and run the scripts to see how Python handles basic programming logic!
