# Python Practice

This repository contains beginner Python scripts.  
Focused on learning and practicing **loops** (`for` and `while`).

## What I Learned
- How to use `for` loops with `range()`
- How `while` loops work and when to use them
- Loop-based logic and flow

## Files Included

- `sum_to_n.py` – Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a user-defined number
- `countdown.py` – Counts down from a user-given number to 0 using a `while` loop
- `multiplication_table.py` – Prints a multiplication table from 1 to 12 for any number
